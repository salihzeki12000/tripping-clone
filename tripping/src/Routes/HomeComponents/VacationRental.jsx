                <p className='text-justify font-weight-lighter'>Vacation rentals can offer more space, privacy, and flexibility compared to hotel rooms. Depending on the property, you’ll have access to amenities like hot tubs, gourmet kitchens, washer/dryers, free onsite parking, private pools, and so many more.</p>
                <p className='text-justify font-weight-lighter'>Vacation rentals are available in a wide range of locations so you can choose where you want to stay, like the center of the city or a local neighborhood with great nightlife. Plus, if you’re traveling with your family or a large group, having multiple bedrooms and bathrooms means there’s enough space so everyone can stay together under one roof.</p>
                <p className='text-justify font-weight-lighter'>Last but not least, at rates of up to 80% off traditional hotel rooms, vacation rentals are often the most affordable, cost effective option. So if you’d like to feel ‘home away from home’ on your next trip, in a place where you can cook, lounge and entertain? Stay in a vacation rental.</p>
